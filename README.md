# Week [1] Knowledge Base Learning Sandbox

## Card Topics

- Card 1: [CSS Loading Strategies: Inline, External, and Code Splitting] - Issue #[56]
- Card 2: [Responsive Typography for Readability: Font Size and Line Length] - Issue #[48]

## Card 1 Learning Journey

### Experiments Conducted

[Describe what you tried]

### Key Discoveries

[What worked? What didn't?]

### Challenges Faced

[What was difficult?]

## Card 2 Learning Journey

### Experiments Conducted

[I made a test using the AI to build my coding example with varying degrees of adjustment. Clamps used for the inbetweens of the @medias and of course using the @medias to build queries for screen size adjustments. ]

### Key Discoveries

[At first the AI didn't write exactly what I was looking for but eventually we got it down and now the example text for the card works!]

### Challenges Faced

[As mentioned before, the coding example for the font-size and line length had some difficulty in getting everything that I wanted working in order but once that hurdle was jumped it was smooth sailing.]

## Weekly Reflection

### What concepts clicked for you this week?

[Both topics this week made sense for me. I rather enjoyed the research I conducted for both of the cards, it was a great opportunity to fully understand some topics I was only familiar with.]

### What are you still exploring?

[Your response]

### How did AI assistance help your learning?

[The AI was a big help in creating the coding examples for my cards. In each I conceptualized the examples but I saved a lot of time using the copilot to write them for me and modify what the AI wrote after. ]

### What will you do differently next week?

[I'll definitely take more time to use the copilot more effectively. This week I only used it at a basic level, I think I can get more out of it in the coming weeks.]
